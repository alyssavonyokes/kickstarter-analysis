# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends. The focus is specifically on campaigns in the United States and further on the Parent Category "Theatre" and Subcategory "Plays".

### Challenge

The first chart "Parent Category Outcomes" provides a visualization of the Theatre types and their sucess overall based on Country. After filtering to the United States, we see that there are far more Play kickstarters being launched at first glance compared to other theatre types such as Spaces and Musicals.

Next when focusing in on the "Subcategory Statistics" chart, we see that 412 of those 671 kickstarters that are plays were successful.

In the terms of campaign goals, we see that the most successful campaigns also have goals set below $45,000 (shown below).

After, we look at the chart "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" and see that the months of May and June come out on top for the months that have the highest number of successful kickstarter campaignes across 2009-2017 around the world.

### Conclusion

Based on the above findings, in the United States, Plays have been sucessful overall being fundraised through Kickstarter when launched in the month of May. The statistics are relatively easy to follow because of the consistant data, and not all over the map like other categories. I reccommend that a new play's kickstarter should launch in the United States in the month of May for a higher liklihood of success. While maintaining a goal of under $45,000, launching in the month of May, and focusing on a play as a theatre production one will have a fairly successful campaign according to the data.

### Limitations and Suggestions

I believe it would also be important to filter by deadline. Factoring in deadline we would see the legnth of time all successful campaigns were active and use that as a parameter for a successful play campaign in the United States. Also, I believe a limitation to this data is the lack of information regarding the type of advertising they ran for their campaign, along with the amount of data/information and design of their campaign page. All of this information would assist in refining what is needed for a successful campaign in the Theatre, and more specifically, Play realm in the United States.
