# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on kickstarter data to uncover trends. The focus is specifically on campaigns in the United States and further on the Parent Category "Theatre" and Subcategory "Plays".

The first pivot chart "Parent Category Outcomes" provides a visualization of the Theatre types and their sucess overall based on Country. After filtering to the United States, we see that there are far more Play kickstarters being launched at first glance compared to Spaces and Musicals.

Next when looking at the pivot chart "Subcategory Statistics" we then see that 412 of those 671 kickstarters were successful.

After, we look at the pivot chart "Outcomes Based on Launch Date" and see that the months of May and June come out on top for the months that have the highest number of successful kickstarter campaignes across 2009-2017 around the world.

Based on the above findings, in the United States, Plays have been sucessful overall being fundraised through Kickstarter when launched in the month of May. The statistics are relatively easy to follow because of the consistant data and not all over the map like other categories. I reccomend that Louise launch her play's kickstarter in the United States in the month of May for a higher liklihood of success.
